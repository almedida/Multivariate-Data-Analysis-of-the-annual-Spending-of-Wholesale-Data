<p><b>Data Analysis of the Annual Spending of Wholesale Distributors’ Clients,			Dec. 2020 </b></p>
<p><b>North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND.</b></p>
<ul><li>Built predictive and classification models to obtain inferences on the annual spending volume of some wholesale distributors’ clients of major grocery and home use products using R and SAS. The data largely contained geographic variables, products and channels of distribution</li>
<li>Performed segmentation analysis using K-Means algorithm to identify the clients’ buying patterns of diverse product categories associated with different channels and regions</li>
<li>Used discriminant analysis to determine variables that contribute most to the separation of channels and classify the customers into distribution channels. I achieved a 15% misclassification error rate</li>
<li>Identified high potential growth opportunities that can lead to an increase in annual spending of consumers of the products and recommended both retail and customer channels where advertisements can be impactful based on buying trends and latent variables analysis in the model</li>
  <li>Overall, I believe my recommendations would increase the company's revenue by at least 25%</li></ul>
